This project involves building a robotic car controlled via Bluetooth using a Raspberry Pi Pico. The car's movement is managed through an MIT App Inventor app, which sends commands to the car's Bluetooth module (HC-06). It is equipped with an L298N motor driver to control the carâ€™s motors, enabling forward, backward, left, and right motion. This project demonstrates the integration of hardware and software.
